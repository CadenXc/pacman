# pacman
a  c++ pacman game

This project is a practical exercise to apply concepts learned from *Code Complete* and various C++ programming books.

I'm still learning, so your ideas and feedback are very welcome!

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to share advice, please open an Issue.

Thank you for helping me improve this project!

Since this is a classic game, there are plenty of resources available online, so I don't have to start entirely from scratch.
I can read and learn from others' code, and that's the beauty of open source.

I decide finish it by 2025/1/26

I plan to start with a text-based version of Pacman and then transition to a graphical version using SDL2.
