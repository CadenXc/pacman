/*This class will be contained in the Ghost.h file, 
I will use this class to set the AI for the ghosts in the game.
Now my thoughts are that this class will be a base class 
for the different AI patterns for the ghosts(pinky,inky,blinky,clyde) and
the different AI patterns when the ghost are in the different modes(chase,scatter,frightened).
When the ghosts are in defferent modes, I just the set the defferent AI patterns for the ghosts.
