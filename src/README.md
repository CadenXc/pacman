I plan to start with a text-based version of Pacman and then transition to a graphical version using SDL2.

here is my plan.
The basic entrance 
The state management.
The map load from json file.
The charater && ghosts
ghosts' AI

a little thinking. I can have a familar tech, use fsm. But It looks too big to this project.

I'm not sure which design is better, but I think it's better to finish the game first.
